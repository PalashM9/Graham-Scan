# Graham Scan Algorithm Implementation

## Overview
This project implements the Graham Scan algorithm in Java. The Graham Scan algorithm is a method of computing the convex hull of a given set of points in the plane. 

## Features
- Generated a set of random points within specified bounds.
- Calculated the convex hull of the given points using the Graham Scan algorithm.

## Usage
To run the program:
1. Compile `Main.java`.
2. Execute the compiled class.

The program will generate a set of random points and then compute their convex hull.

## Implementation Details
- `Main.java`: Contains the main method which initiates the process.
- `GrahamScan` class: Implements the core logic for the Graham Scan algorithm.
    - `generatePoints`: Method to generate a set of random points.
    - `scan`: Method to compute the convex hull of the given points.
